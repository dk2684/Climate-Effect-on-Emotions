#### Research Question: 
Does climate, specifically annual average rainfall, hours of sun, and temperature, influence depression and suicide rates for a state?

#### Overview:
In this project our group wanted to explore possible correlations between climate attributes and mental health. We defined our climate attributes as annual average rainfall, sun hours, and temperature as those for mental health as suicide and depression rates. The data we used in this project was collected from various reputable sources such as the CDC, National Climate Data Center, and World Data Center for Meteorology. Our data spanned a range of five years and was located in the United States. First we explored the data using scatterplots, then we analyzed our data using ordinary least squares (OLS), linear regression, and t-tests. Overall, our analysis showed average annual rainfall and hours of sun influenced suicide rates in a state.

#### Conclusion:
We found support to reject the null hypothesis.
